/**
 * PromptPreset — movie-level prompt scaffolding.
 *
 * The tool does not call the video engine (씨댄스/Runway); the director copies a
 * Shot's prompt into the engine by hand. To avoid retyping the boilerplate
 * ("cinematic 4K …") and the negative constraints on every Shot, a single
 * movie-level preset holds three slots, each a distinct concern:
 *  - `prefix`: common text prepended to EVERY Shot prompt, regardless of look.
 *  - `suffix`: common negatives appended to EVERY Shot prompt.
 *  - `looks`:  named camera/film/grade packages (a `look` -> full-prefix map).
 *    A Scene/Shot picks one by its `look` key; the package is inserted BETWEEN
 *    prefix and body. The reserved key `default` applies to Scenes/Shots that
 *    declare no `look`. `looks` is generic: the tool never hard-codes any key
 *    name (e.g. fantasy/reality) — those live in the movie's data.
 *
 * Layering rationale: prefix and a look are DIFFERENT slots (both can apply);
 * a look does NOT replace prefix. Empty `looks` ⇒ legacy behaviour (prefix →
 * body → suffix), so existing movies are untouched.
 *
 * Refs are written INLINE in the Shot prompt as `@name` (not a generated ref
 * block) — the engine resolves `@name` to the registered reference image. The
 * set of valid `@names` is the project's ImageReference `refName`s (see
 * `collectRefNames` in movie.ts), NOT a list stored on the preset.
 *
 * `assembleFinalPrompt` derives the copy-paste string on the fly — only the
 * pieces (preset + Shot.prompt) live on disk, never the assembled whole.
